  <h1>Analyzing Factors Related to Crime Rates in Washington State Counties</h1>
  <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Ding, Katherine Liu, Iris Zhou</p>

  <h2>Summary of Questions and Results</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis focused on three areas of interest: types of offenses reported,
    unemployment rate, and population density. We analyzed how each of
    these factors relate to location and crime rates.
  </p>
  <h3>Types of criminal offenses:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>What types of crime occur most frequently in different counties?</summary>
        <p>
          Theft is the most frequently occuring type of offense in most counties. Assault,
          destruction of property, and burglary are among the second most frequently occuring
          types of crime.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          How does the proportion of types of criminal offenses vary across counties?
        </summary>
        <p>
          The proportion of thefts as compared the proportion of other offesnes reported is
          highest in King County and in other Puget Sound area counties. The proportion of
          assaults reported is lower in comparison in those counties.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Is there a relationship between population size and the proportion of theft
            and assault?
          </summary>
          <p>
            There may be a weak positive correlation between population size and the
            proportion of thefts in counties. There appears to be little to no relationship
            between population size and the proportion of assault in counties.
          </p>
        </details>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          How has the relative frequency of different types of crime changed over time
          different counties?
        </summary>
        <p>
          In more populated counties, the relative frequency of crime types experience
          little to no change over time. Larger counties also have a larger gap between the
          relative frequency of the most frequent crime type and of
          the second most frequent crime type.
          <br><br>
          Less populated counties experience more fluctuation in relative frequency of crime
          types and have less of a gap between the most frequent and second most frequent
          crime types.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unemployment rate:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Is there a strong correlation between unemployment rate and crime rates?
        </summary>
        <p>
          There is a weakly positive relationship between the total crime rate and the
          unemployment rate within each county. However, the total crime rate does not
          respond to changes of the unemployment rate very sensitively.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Which type of crime "responds" to the unemployment rate most sensitively?
        </summary>
        <p>
          Burglary and theft incidents have a weakly positive relationship with unemployment.
          There's no strong evidence showing there's a strong correlation between the
          unemployment rate with other types of criminal offenses.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Population density:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>How does the population density of counties affect the crime rate?</summary>
        <p>
          The population density in Washington state has a positive correlation with the
          crime rate, but the relation is not very obvious.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Which type of crime highly relates to population density?</summary>
        <p>
          The crime type, theft, has the strongest relationship with population density
          in Washington state.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <h3>Overall motivation</h3>
  <p>
    It is helpful to know the trend of crime types in different areas of Washington,
    so that the government can use specific measures to deal with the crimes and improve
    safety for the citizens.
