  <h1>Analyzing Factors Related to Crime Rates in Washington State Counties</h1>
  <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Caroline Ding, Katherine Liu, Iris Zhou</p>

  <h2>Summary of Questions and Results</h2>
  <p>
    Our analysis focused on three areas of interest: types of offenses reported,
    unemployment rate, and population density. We analyzed how each of
    these factors relate to location and crime rates.
  </p>
  <h3>Types of criminal offenses:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>What types of crime occur most frequently in different counties?</summary>
        <p class="results">
          Theft is the most frequently occuring type of offense in most counties. Assault,
          destruction of property, and burglary are among the second most frequently occuring
          types of crime.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          How does the proportion of types of criminal offenses vary across counties?
        </summary>
        <p class="results">
          The proportion of thefts as compared the proportion of other offenses reported is
          highest in King County and in other Puget Sound area counties. The proportion of
          assaults reported is lower in comparison in those counties.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Is there a relationship between population size and the proportion of theft
            and assault?
          </summary>
          <p class="results">
            There may be a weak positive correlation between population size and the
            proportion of thefts in counties. There appears to be little to no relationship
            between population size and the proportion of assault in counties.
          </p>
        </details>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          How has the relative frequency of different types of crime changed over time
          different counties?
        </summary>
        <p class="results">
          In more populated counties, the relative frequency of crime types experience
          little to no change over time. Larger counties also have a larger gap between the
          relative frequency of the most frequent crime type and of
          the second most frequent crime type.
          <br><br>
          Less populated counties experience more fluctuation in relative frequency of crime
          types and have less of a gap between the most frequent and second most frequent
          crime types.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Unemployment rate:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Is there a strong correlation between unemployment rate and crime rates?
        </summary>
        <p class="results">
          There is a weakly positive relationship between the total crime rate and the
          unemployment rate within each county. However, the total crime rate does not
          respond to changes of the unemployment rate very sensitively.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>
          Which type of crime "responds" to the unemployment rate most sensitively?
        </summary>
        <p class="results">
          Burglary and theft incidents have a weakly positive relationship with unemployment.
          There's no strong evidence showing there's a strong correlation between the
          unemployment rate with other types of criminal offenses.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Population density:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>How does the population density of counties affect the crime rate?</summary>
        <p class="results">
          The population density in Washington state has a positive correlation with the
          crime rate, but the relation is not very obvious.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
    <li>
      <details>
        <summary>Which type of crime highly relates to population density?</summary>
        <p class="results">
          The crime type, theft, has the strongest relationship with population density
          in Washington state.
        </p>
      </details>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Motivation</h2>
  <h3>Overall motivation</h3>
  <p>
    It is helpful to know the trend of crime types in different areas of Washington,
    so that the government can use specific measures to deal with the crimes and improve
    safety for the citizens.
  </p>
  <h3>Why do we care about these areas of interest?</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Types of criminal offenses:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Understanding more about what and where crimes are taking place can help inform
        decisions about what policies and actions may be taken to reduce crime in different
        counties. Seeing how proportions of crime types have changed over time can indicate
        whether certain policy changes have or have not been effective.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Unemployment rate:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        To explore if unemployment rate actually has an influence on crime If it does, knowing
        which types of crimes more sensitively respond to unemployment rate can help the
        government take actions towards specific types of crimes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Population density:</strong></li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When looking through the crime map, it seems the places that have higher population
        densities are more likely to have high crime rates. And crimes often happen in places
        such as downtown or some bustling cities. This phenomenon motivates me to think about
        the question, is the population density the major factor that affects the crime rate,
        and how strongly it relates to the crime rate or some specific crime type. Exploring
        these questions could help people to understand what factor affects the crime rate the most,
        and the government could figure out a way to reduce the crime rate efficiently by focusing
        on the major factor of the crime rate.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Using the melted/longer dataset, group observations by county, and get the crime type
              with the highest proportion for each county. Then, to get the second most frequently
              reported type of crime, do the same, but excluding the type for each county that was
              the most frequently reported.
            </li>
            <li>
              Merge the DataFrames of the county geometries and the first and second most
              frequently reported types of offenses for each county to display data on an
              interactive map using plotly. This map will allow the crime type for each county
              to be easily see. Additional information can be obtained by hovering over each county.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Create a method that, given any crime type, filters the longer dataframe by the crime
              type and maps (using plotly) the relative proportion of crime that that type makes up
              for each county. Each county should be colored by that proportion, so you can see

            <li>
              For a few crime types, use plotly to graph a scatterplot where x=population and
              y=rate of a crime type for each county, and plot the least squares regression line
              for the data. Use the computed R2 coefficient to discuss whether a weak or strong or

  <h3>Analysis of unemployment rates</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Filtering the data:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Filter out the crime data for Benton, King, Yakima, Spokane, and Snohomish, which are,
        according to the safe cities ranking, counties that are relatively more dangerous and
        require stricter safety regulations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Filter out the unemployment data in 2020 for each county.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Combine the unemployment data of each county into one single dataset.</li>
    <li>
      Draw graphs to compare how unemployment rates change over time from 2012 to 2020
      and how crime incidents change overtime from 2012 to 2020.
    </li>
    <li>Observe if there's strong evidence to draw conclusions on their relationships.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Analysis of population density</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Generating the data:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Change the shape of the population density DataFrame, so it has the same shape as the crime
        DataFrame. Merge the two DataFrames according to the county names and years.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Interactive scatter plot:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the plotly library to create an interactive scatter plot and draw a regression line.
        The graph shows the relationship between the counties with population density greater than
        100 and the crime rate in those counties. Each dot shows the values of the crime rate and
        population density for each county we chose from 2012 to 2020.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Line plots:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Apply the seaborn library to create the two line plots. One shows how the crime rate
        changes over time in King county and Pierce county. The other one shows how population
        density changes over time in King county and Pierce county.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Bar plots:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Show the top five common crime types in four counties with the highest population density
        in bar plots. The x-axis represents the crime counts and the y-axis is the names
        of crime types.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ol>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <h3>Types of criminal offenses</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>What types of crime occur most frequently in different counties?</strong></li>
    <object data="plots/plotly/top_map.html" height="480" width="100%"></object>
    <p>
      In 2020, out of the 39 counties in Washington state, 34 counties reported theft the most
      frequently, and 5 counties (Ferry, Stevens, Garfield, Columbia, and Wahkiakum) reported
      assault the most frequently.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Under the National Incident-Based Reporting System, the "theft" label encompasses
      embezzlement, fraud, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and stolen property offenses.
      The "assault" label encompasses aggravated assault, simple assault, and intimidation.
      [<a href="https://sac.ofm.wa.gov/sites/default/files/public/pdf/nbrs_dictionary.pdf"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIBRS codebook</a>]
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that 4 of these 5 counties are the least populated counties in Washington,
      having less than 8K people. Stevens County is the exception, ranking 24th by population.
      This observation seems to indicate that some relationship may exist between population
      and relative frequency of assault. We will explore the existence of this relationship
      more in Question 2.
    </p>

    <object data="plots/plotly/top2_map.html" height="500" width="100%"></object>
    <p>
      The second most frequently reported offenses in Washington counties include assault,
      destruction of property, theft, and burglary. Looking at both visualizations, we notice
      that in each of the 5 countries where assault was the most frequently reported, theft was
      the second most frequently reported offense. This solidifies the observation that theft and
      assault are most frequent across all counties, regardless of population.
      <br><br>
      Prior to this analysis, I somewhat expected theft to be the most frequent, because out of
      all the crime types recorded, individuals may have the most to directly gain from theft.
      I was surprised to learn that assault is also so frequently reported, since I expected
      non-violent types of crime to be more common.
      <br><br>
      Because the data do not further divide into the subcategories of theft and assault, it is
      possible that these two offenses are most common because they each encompass several
      different types of offenses. The lack of further division also restricts what we can discern
      of the types of offenses that are more commonly committed. The most frequently reported types
      of offenses include both crimes against the person (aggravated assault) and crimes against
      property (burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, destruction of property) as defined
      by the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook.
